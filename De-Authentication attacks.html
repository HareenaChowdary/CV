    <h1>De-Authentication attacks on Rogue UAVs:</h1>
    <p>It Addresses a problem of UAV trespassing into prohibited areas. The device we designed work on WIFI operates drones. This device captures the original transmitter's details and mimics it. This mimicking confuses the drone and the drone disconnects from the original transmitter. Now, the drone operator cannot control the drone and the drone can be captured. This method does not affect any other drone or other devices in the operating area which is an advantage over the other methods such as high emp focusing and using explosives.</p>
